# Unsupervised_ML_with_KMeans : Clustering Songs

This project was desgined to answer the following questions:

- Are Spotify’s audio features able to identify “similar songs”, as defined by humanly detectable criteria? When you listen to two rock ballads, two operas or two drum & bass songs, you identify them as similar songs. Are these similarities detectable using the audio features from Spotify?
  
- Is K-Means a good method to create playlists? Would you stick with this algorithm moving forward, or explore other methods to create playlists?

The purpose: Use Data Science to add a degree of automatisation to the creation of playlists and use a basic clustering algorithm such as K-Means to divide the dataset into a few clusters (which will become playlists).
